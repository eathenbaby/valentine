Role:
You are a senior full-stack developer + product designer + growth hacker.

Objective:
Build a viral Valentine confession website where admins generate shareable confession links, and users send those links to their crushes. The crush opens the link and experiences a cute, meme-filled Valentine proposal page.

🧠 Core Concept (READ CAREFULLY)

People DO NOT enter their crush’s name themselves

Instead:

A user submits their own name (the sender)

The system generates a unique Valentine confession link

That link is shared to their crush

The crush opens the link and sees:

“Hey 👀
Someone has a crush on you…
Will you be my Valentine? 💕”

Sender identity stays hidden unless revealed later.

🔁 Exact Flow
1️⃣ Admin / Submission Flow

Admin dashboard or simple form:

Field: Sender Name

Optional: sender Instagram handle / phone (internal use)

On submit:

Generate a unique confession ID

Create a shareable URL like:

/v/abc123


Admin sends the link to the sender

2️⃣ Crush Experience (Main Page)

When the crush opens the link:

Cutesy animated Valentine page

Message example:

Hey you 🥺💘  
Someone thinks you’re adorable…

Will you be my Valentine?


NO sender name shown initially

😏 Interactive Meme Features (MANDATORY)

Big YES 💕 button

NO 😤 button that:

Runs away on hover

Changes text each time (“You sure?”, “Think again 👀”, “Don’t do me like that 😭”)

YES button:

Grows bigger each time NO is avoided

On click → heart explosion + celebration

🎨 Design & Vibe

Gen-Z, Indian college meme culture

Pastel pinks, reds, soft gradients

Floating hearts, sparkles, emojis

Playful fonts (Comic Sans / rounded / handwritten)

Mobile-first (Instagram browser compatible)

Tone:

Cute, cringe, funny, wholesome, slightly unhinged

💌 Viral Copy Rotation

Rotate funny lines like:

“You > my CGPA fr”

“I’d skip attendance shortage for you”

“You’re my favorite notification”

“Capybaras approve this message 🦫💘”

🛍️ Monetization Layer (IMPORTANT)

After the confession section:

“Make this confession unforgettable 🎁”

Gift cards:

Chocolates

Teddy bear

Love letter

Rose bouquet

CTA:
“Send this confession with a gift”

(Does not interrupt the confession flow)
